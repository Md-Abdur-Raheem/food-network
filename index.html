           <p>Have you had your salad today? Eating salad almost every day may be one of the most healthy eating habits you can adopt -- and one of the simplest, experts say. Eating salads is a super-convenient way to work in a couple of servings of vegetables and/or fruit.</p>

                <p>Don’t let appearances fool you—the decor may be divey, but the pies are fantastic. This place is perfect for groups or a casual date night.</p>

             <h3>2. Faizullah Toushif</h3>
             <p>It may look like your average neighborhood salad joint, but this salad is anything but!
                I wandered in with two friends on a Friday night, and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff and incredible aroma of baking pizza. The restaurant was filling up quickly (it was almost 7:00 pm) but we managed to snag a table.</p>
